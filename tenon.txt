So the WP Theme. Really simple tasks actually, because I'm mostly done.

add the thumbnail class to post thumbnails

unfuck the footer because it floats to the top for some dumb reason

fix minor horizontal scroll

fix grid (right column floats under main content to early)

pagination styling

paginated/ threaded comments styling

adjust line-height of header title (expand it a tad)

undo border around site search on widget column

bbPress styling to match main site
